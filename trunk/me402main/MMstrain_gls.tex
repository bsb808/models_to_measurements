name={strain gage},
description={In general, a strain gage is a sensor (a transducer) that transforms strain into a measureable quantity.  For our purposes a strain gage refers to a metallic foil strain gage bonded to the surface of a structure.  This type of strain gage changes resistance in response to an applied deformation in a known way}
