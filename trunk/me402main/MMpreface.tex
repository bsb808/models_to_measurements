\chapter{Preface}

This book is an extention of the course notes developed for the undergraduate course \emph{ME 402: Dynamic System Laboratory} at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  

The concept of tranlating my course-specific notes into a (slightly) more general textbook is the result of working with Professor Allen Downey at Olin College.  Professor Downey is a prophet of free books and has authored many which he distributes at Green Tea Press (\url{http://greenteapress.com/}).
